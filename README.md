# Hey there, I'm @RuLevyDev! 😃

## What I’m into 🚀
I'm all about building cutting-edge web and mobile applications. I love diving into new technologies and frameworks, and I'm always on the lookout for the next exciting project.

## What I’m learning 📚
Right now, I'm diving into Rust for some system-level programming magic. I already have a solid grasp of Flutter and Dart, and I’m always looking to level up my skills.

## Let’s Collaborate 🤝
Got a cool full-stack project? Need some mobile app expertise? Let’s team up and create something amazing together! I’m especially into projects that use Dart, C#, and innovative solutions.

## Fun Facts 🎉
- "An idiot admires complexity; a genius admires simplicity." I strive for simplicity in my code and solutions.
- Optimization Rules:
  - Rule 1: Don't do it.
  - Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet.
- "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." Seriously, let's not make things complicated before we need to!
