## What I’m into 🚀
I'm all about building cutting-edge web and mobile applications. I love diving into new technologies and frameworks, and I'm always on the lookout for the next exciting project.

## What I’m learning 📚
I’m diving into Rust for some system-level programming magic and keeping my skills sharp with:

- C#: When I need to feel powerful and sophisticated.
- Java: The coffee of programming languages. ☕
- JavaScript: Making the web a little more interactive, one line at a time.
- HTML & CSS: Crafting beautiful and responsive UIs.
- HTMX: Because static pages are so last century.
- Astro: For building super-fast websites without breaking a sweat.
- React: Adding a bit of magic to the user interface.
- Dart & Flutter: Creating smooth and stunning mobile apps that work like a charm.
- Android Java: For when I want to dive into native Android development.
- SQL or NoSQL: Depending on whether I’m feeling structured or flexible.
- Azure & Firebase: My go-to cloud services for scaling up and keeping things running smoothly.
- Google Analytics: Watching over the traffic to see how well my creations are performing.
